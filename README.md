# Big-5-OCEAN-model-clustering---Data-science-project

100K cases /109 columns dataset of a personality test, which examine 5 personality dimensions. 
 - Objective: Identifying typical personalities among subjects.
 - A thorough EDA was applied in order to reduce irrelevant and co-liniared features.
 - Special authentication test feature was designed , based on response times, in order to exclude ingenuine cases.
 - Dimensionality reduction was further applied by an auto-encoder algorithm. 
 - Finally, we applied a linkage clustering algorithm in order to identify distinct groups among subjects. 
 - Observing 4 significantly distinct groups in our dataset, we analyzed between groups differences in all 5 personality traits. 

the project was conducted as final project for professional data-scientist course, under supervision of Amit Rappel, Senior lecturer at Naya-Tech.
